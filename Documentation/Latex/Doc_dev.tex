  \section{Introduction}

  BTK stands for Baby Brain Toolkit. This toolkit is developed in the context of
  the Fbrain ERC project: ``Computational Anatomy of Fetal
  Brain''\footnote{http://lsiit-miv.u-strasbg.fr/miv/index.php?contenu=erc}. 
  Studies about brain maturation aim at providing a better understanding of brain
  development and links between brain changes and cognitive development. Such
  studies are of great interest for diagnosis help and clinical course of
  development and treatment of illnesses. Several teams have begun to make 3D maps
  of developing brain structures from children to young adults. However, working
  out the development of fetal and neonatal brain remains an open issue. This
  project aims at jumping over several theoretical and practical barriers and at
  going beyond the formal description of the brain maturation thanks to the
  development of a realistic numerical model of brain aging.

  \subsection{Installation}

  \subsubsection{Dependencies}

  Baby Brain Toolkit (BTK) is written in C++ and needs the following packages\footnote{BTK has been tested under Debian 5.0 and MacOSX 10.6.8}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \href{http://www.cmake.org}{CMake}, \href{http://tclap.sourceforge.net}{Tclap}, \href{http://openmp.org}{OpenMP}, \href{http://www.vtk.org}{VTK}, ANN (www.cs.umd.edu/\string~mount/ANN) and Doxygen. These
  libraries can be installed using the following command line: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item for debian-based distributions: \texttt{apt-get install cmake
  cmake-curses-gui libtclap-dev libgomp1 libann-dev doxygen}
  \item for MacOSX using macports\footnote{When configuring in cmake, please use /opt/local/include for TCLAP\_DIRECTORY}: \texttt{port install cmake tclap libANN doxygen}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Install Git: this library can be installed using the following command line : 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item for debian-based distribution: \texttt{apt-get install git-core}
  \item for MacOSX using macports: \texttt{port install git-core}
  \end{itemize}
  \item \href{http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html}{Insight Toolkit (ITK) version 4.3.1}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Download the tar.gz archive of ITK v4.3.1
  \item Extract the archive 
  \item Then open a terminal and type :
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{verbatim}
  mkdir ITK-build
  cd ITK-build
  ccmake ../(your-ITK-Source-folder)/
  \end{verbatim}
  This will bring up the CMake configuration screen. Press \texttt{[c]} for
  configure and then use \texttt{[t]} to toggle the advanced mode. Make the
  following changes:
  \begin{verbatim}
  BUILD_TESTING = OFF
  ITK_USE_REVIEW = ON
  ITK_BUILD_ALL_MODULES = ON
  ITKV3_COMPATIBILITY = ON
  BUILD_DOCUMENTATION = OFF
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release
  \end{verbatim}
  Or for debugging and development purpose :
  \begin{verbatim}
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug

  \end{verbatim}
  Then press \texttt{[c]} to configure and \texttt{[g]} to generate the make file.
  Finally, go to the build folder of ITK (ITK-build) and type \texttt{make} at the prompt to obtain the final build of ITK.
   \item \href{http://www.vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html#previous}{Visualization ToolKit (VTK) version 5.10.1 }
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Download the tar.gz archive of VTK v5.10.1
 \item Extract the archive 
 \item Then open a terminal and type :
 \end{itemize}
  \begin{verbatim}
  mkdir VTK-build
  cd VTK-build
  ccmake ../(your-VTK-Source-folder)/
  \end{verbatim}
  This will bring up the CMake configuration screen. Press \texttt{[c]} for
  configure and then use \texttt{[t]} to toggle the advanced mode. Make the
  following changes:
  \begin{verbatim}
  BUILD_TESTING = OFF
  BUILD_EXAMPLE = OFF
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release
  \end{verbatim}
  Or for debugging and developement purpose :
  \begin{verbatim}
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug

\end{verbatim}

  \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection{Download the BTK sources}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Get the BTK sources:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For the Latest stable version :
    \begin{verbatim}
    git clone https://github.com/rousseau/fbrain.git
    git checkout Btk_1.0 
    \end{verbatim}
    \item For the current development version :
    \begin{verbatim}
    git clone https://github.com/rousseau/fbrain.git
    \end{verbatim}  
    \end{itemize}
  \item Then for compiling:
  \begin{verbatim}
  mkdir fbrain-build
  cd fbrain-build
  ccmake ../fbrain
  \end{verbatim}
  Make the following changes on the CMake configuration screen :
  \begin{verbatim}
  ITK_DIR = (YOUR-ITK-BUILD-FOLDER)
  VTK_DIR = (YOUR-VTK-BUILD-FOLDER)
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release
  \end{verbatim}
  Or for debugging and developement purpose :
  \begin{verbatim}
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug
  \end{verbatim}
  then :
  \begin{verbatim}
  make
  \end{verbatim}

  \end{itemize}

  Most of the programs of the BTK suite use the OpenMP library for multi-threading
  purpose. The number of cores used can be tuned using the following command line
  (in this example, 4 cores will be used): \texttt{export OMP\_NUM\_THREADS=4}
