\section{Introduction}

BTK stands for Baby Brain Toolkit. This toolkit is developed in the context of
the Fbrain ERC project: ``Computational Anatomy of Fetal
Brain''\footnote{http://lsiit-miv.u-strasbg.fr/miv/index.php?contenu=erc}. 
Studies about brain maturation aim at providing a better understanding of brain
development and links between brain changes and cognitive development. Such
studies are of great interest for diagnosis help and clinical course of
development and treatment of illnesses. Several teams have begun to make 3D maps
of developing brain structures from children to young adults. However, working
out the development of fetal and neonatal brain remains an open issue. This
project aims at jumping over several theoretical and practical barriers and at
going beyond the formal description of the brain maturation thanks to the
development of a realistic numerical model of brain aging.

\subsection{Installation}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

Baby Brain Toolkit (BTK) needs the following packages\footnote{BTK has been tested under Debian 5.0 and MacOSX 10.6.8}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item CMake (www.cmake.org), Tclap (tclap.sourceforge.net), OpenMP
(openmp.org), VTK (www.vtk.org), ANN (www.cs.umd.edu/\string~mount/ANN) and Doxygen. These
libraries can be installed using the following command line: 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item for debian-based distributions: \texttt{apt-get install cmake
cmake-curses-gui libtclap-dev libgomp1 libvtk5-dev libann-dev doxygen}
 \item for MacOSX using macports: \texttt{port install cmake tclap vtk5 libANN doxygen}
 \end{itemize}
 \item Install Git: this library can be installed using the following command line : 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item for debian-based distribution: \texttt{apt-get install git-core}
 \item for MacOSX using macports: \texttt{port install git-core}
 \end{itemize}
 \item Insight Toolkit (ITK) version 4\footnote{As there is still not a stable version for ITK4, there are potential compilation problems when using the HEAD version. We have tested BTK with the version of ITK corresponding to the tag v4.0a08.}:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone git://itk.org/ITK.git
git checkout v4.0a08
mkdir ITK-build
cd ITK-build
ccmake ../ITK/
\end{verbatim}
This will bring up the CMake configuration screen. Press \texttt{[c]} for
configure and then use \texttt{[t]} to toggle the advanced mode. Make the
following changes:
\begin{verbatim}
BUILD_TESTING = OFF
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release
ITK_USE_REVIEW = ON
ITK_BUILD_ALL_MODULES = ON
BUILD_DOCUMENTATION = ON
\end{verbatim}
Then press \texttt{[c]} to configure and \texttt{[g]} to generate the make file.
Finally, type \texttt{make} at the prompt to obtain the final build of ITK.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Download and compile the BTK sources}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Get the BTK sources: \texttt{git clone https://github.com/rousseau/fbrain.git }
 \item Then:
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir fbrain-build
cd fbrain-build
ccmake ../fbrain
make
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

Most of the programs of the BTK suite use the OpenMP library for multi-threading
purpose. The number of cores used can be tuned using the following command line
(in this example, 4 cores will be used): \texttt{export OMP\_NUM\_THREADS=4}
\input{pipeline}
\input{app}
\input{utilities}
