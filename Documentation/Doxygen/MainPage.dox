 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Fbrain is a ERC funded project. The purpose of this project is to develop
 * image processing tools for a better understanding of the fetal brain
 * development. Studies about brain maturation aim at providing a better
 * understanding of brain development and links between brain changes and
 * cognitive development. Such studies are of great interest for diagnosis help
 * and clinical course of development and treatment of illnesses. Several teams
 * have begun to make 3D maps of developing brain structures from children to
 * young adults. However, working out the development of fetal and neonatal
 * brain remains an open issue. This project aims at jumping over several
 * theoretical and practical barriers and at going beyond the formal description
 * of the brain maturation thanks to the development of a realistic numerical
 * model of brain aging. BTK (baby brain toolkit), which is the toolkit developed
 * for the fbrain project, consists of several image processing tools: image
 * reconstruction, image denoising, image segmentation, tractography etc.
 *
 * \section Dependencies
 *
 * Baby Brain Toolkit (BTK) depends on CMake, ITK, VTK, Tclap library and OpenMP.
