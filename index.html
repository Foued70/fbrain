			Fbrain is a ERC funded project. The purpose
			of this project is to develop image processing tools for a better
			understanding of the fetal brain development. 
		</div>


		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Studies about brain maturation aim at providing a better
			understanding of brain development and links between brain changes and
			cognitive development. Such studies are of great interest for diagnosis
			help and clinical course of development and treatment of illnesses.
			Several teams have begun to make 3D maps of developing brain structures
			from children to young adults. However, working out the development of
			fetal and neonatal brain remains an open issue. This project aims at
			jumping over several theoretical and practical barriers and at
			going beyond the formal description of the brain maturation thanks to
			the development of a realistic numerical model of brain aging.
			<br>
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			BTK (baby brain toolkit),
			which is the toolkit developed for the fbrain project, consists of
			several image processing tools: image reconstruction, image denoising,
			image segmentation, tractography etc.

		<p>
			Download the sources. Create a directory 'fbrain-build' (mkdir
			fbrain-build), and then compile:<font size="-1"><br></font>
		</p>
		<p>
			<font size="-1">
			cd fbrain-build<br>
			cmake ../fbrain<br>
			make
